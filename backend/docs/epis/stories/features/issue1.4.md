# Issue 1.4: Comprehensive Backend Test Suite Development

## Goal
Create a complete, robust test suite for the entire FunBankApp backend that covers all APIs, controllers, services, and edge cases with 100% test coverage.

## Current Status
- [x] Basic test infrastructure is set up
- [x] Some tests exist but many are failing
- [x] Missing tests for several controllers and services

## Task List

### Phase 1: Fix Existing Failing Tests
- [x] Fix UserControllerTest - Mock setup issues and edge cases
- [ ] Fix AccountControllerTest - Mock setup issues and edge cases
- [ ] Fix all DAO tests - Ensure proper mocking
- [ ] Fix any remaining test compilation errors

### Phase 2: Add Missing Controller Tests
- [ ] Create BudgetControllerTest
- [ ] Create GoalControllerTest
- [ ] Create TransactionControllerTest
- [ ] Create DashboardControllerTest
- [ ] Create AnalyticsControllerTest
- [ ] Create AIChatControllerTest

### Phase 3: Add Missing Service Tests
- [ ] Create FinancialAnalysisServiceTest
- [ ] Create JwtServiceTest
- [ ] Create CookieAuthFilterTest

### Phase 4: Add Integration Tests
- [ ] Create end-to-end authentication flow tests
- [ ] Create complete transaction flow tests
- [ ] Create budget management flow tests
- [ ] Create goal tracking flow tests

### Phase 5: Add Edge Case and Error Handling Tests
- [ ] Test all error scenarios (400, 401, 403, 500)
- [ ] Test null/empty input handling
- [ ] Test invalid data formats
- [ ] Test concurrent access scenarios
- [ ] Test database connection failures

### Phase 6: Performance and Security Tests
- [ ] Add load testing for critical endpoints
- [ ] Test CSRF protection
- [ ] Test authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] Test SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Test XSS prevention

### Phase 7: Test Infrastructure Improvements
- [ ] Add test data builders/factories
- [ ] Add test utilities for common operations
- [ ] Configure test coverage reporting
- [ ] Add test documentation

## Updates
- **2025-06-24**: Issue created. Starting with fixing existing failing tests.
- **2025-06-24**: Fixed UserControllerTest with proper mocking and edge cases.
- **2025-06-24**: Fixed AccountControllerTest mock setup issues (createAccount test now passes).
- **2025-06-24**: Identified remaining issues in AccountControllerTest - NullPointerException in userDAO.findByUsername() calls and analyze endpoint not returning content.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass (0 failures)
- [ ] 90%+ code coverage
- [ ] All controllers have comprehensive test suites
- [ ] All edge cases are covered
- [ ] Tests run in under 2 minutes
- [ ] Clear test documentation exists

## Notes
- Focus on business logic testing, not framework testing
- Use proper mocking to isolate units under test
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Ensure tests are maintainable and readable
