# Issue 1.1: Backend Login StackOverflowError - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem
The backend login endpoint `/api/auth/login` was throwing a StackOverflowError, preventing the frontend from authenticating users. This was blocking the entire authentication flow.

## Error Details
- **Error**: `java.lang.StackOverflowError` - RESOLVED ✅
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/login` - NOW WORKING ✅
- **Frontend Error**: 500 Internal Server Error - RESOLVED ✅
- **Backend Log**: `Handler dispatch failed: java.lang.StackOverflowError` - RESOLVED ✅

## Root Cause Analysis
StackOverflowError typically occurs due to:
1. Infinite recursion in method calls
2. Circular references in entity relationships
3. Misconfigured DTO/entity mapping
4. Bidirectional relationships causing infinite serialization

## Root Cause Identified
The issue was caused by:
1. **Spring Security Configuration Conflict**: The backend was failing to start due to a conflict between the custom UserDetailsService and Spring Boot's auto-configured InMemoryUserDetailsManager
2. **Missing database field mapping**: The UserDAO `findByEmail` method was not selecting the `username` field, causing BeanPropertyRowMapper to fail
3. **Incomplete object creation**: This led to incomplete User objects being created, which caused the StackOverflowError during authentication

## Tasks
- [x] Examine the AuthController login method for recursive calls
- [x] Check User entity relationships for circular references
- [x] Review DTO mapping configurations
- [x] Analyze JWT authentication flow for infinite loops
- [x] Check UserDetailsService implementation
- [x] Verify Spring Security configuration
- [x] Test login endpoint with minimal payload
- [x] Add debugging logs to trace the execution flow
- [x] Fix the identified root cause
- [x] Test login functionality end-to-end

## Fixes Applied
1. **Fixed Spring Security Configuration**: Removed the explicit UserDetailsService bean definition that was causing conflicts
2. **Fixed UserDAO findByEmail method** to include all User entity fields including `username`
3. **Added proper constructors** to User entity
4. **Added debug logging** to the login method to track authentication flow
5. **Verified application.properties** has the correct security user configuration

## Current Status: LOGIN WORKING ✅
- **Login endpoint**: Returns 200 OK with valid credentials ✅
- **No StackOverflowError**: Backend logs show successful authentication ✅
- **Frontend can authenticate**: Login requests are successful ✅
- **Session management**: Working correctly ✅

## Profile Endpoint Fix - RESOLVED ✅
The `/api/auth/profile` endpoint was returning 400 Bad Request due to potential null values in user data and insufficient error handling.

## Fixes Applied for Profile Endpoint
1. **Enhanced Null Checking**: Added comprehensive null checks for authentication and user data
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Added specific error responses for different failure scenarios
3. **Better User Data Handling**: Safely handle null values in user fields (firstName, lastName, createdAt)
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging to track authentication flow
5. **Added Integration Test**: Created `testLoginToProfileFlow_Success()` to verify complete flow

## Current Status: ALL AUTHENTICATION WORKING ✅
- **Login endpoint**: Returns 200 OK with valid credentials ✅
- **No StackOverflowError**: Backend logs show successful authentication ✅
- **Frontend can authenticate**: Login requests are successful ✅
- **Session management**: Working correctly ✅
- **Profile endpoint**: Returns 200 OK with user data ✅
- **Complete auth flow**: Login → Profile works end-to-end ✅

## Priority
**RESOLVED** - All authentication endpoints are now working correctly

## Dependencies
- Backend Spring Boot application
- Frontend authentication flow
- Database connection

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Login endpoint returns 200 OK with valid credentials
- [x] No StackOverflowError in backend logs
- [x] Frontend can successfully authenticate users
- [x] Profile endpoint returns 200 OK with user data
- [x] Session management works correctly across all endpoints
