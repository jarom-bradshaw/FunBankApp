# Issue 4.1: Implement GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

## 🎯 **Goal**
Set up a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment processes for the FunBankApp backend.

## 📋 **Task List**
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for continuous integration
- [ ] Set up automated testing on every push and PR
- [ ] Implement code quality checks (SonarQube/CodeQL)
- [ ] Add security scanning for dependencies
- [ ] Create staging deployment workflow
- [ ] Set up production deployment workflow
- [ ] Add environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Implement automated database migrations
- [ ] Add performance testing in pipeline
- [ ] Create deployment notifications (Slack/Discord)

## 🔧 **Technical Requirements**

### **CI Pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml)**
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up JDK 21
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '21'
          distribution: 'temurin'
      - name: Cache Gradle packages
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.gradle/caches
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*', '**/gradle-wrapper.properties') }}
      - name: Run tests
        run: ./gradlew test
      - name: Build application
        run: ./gradlew build
      - name: Security scan
        run: ./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze
      - name: Upload test results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: test-results
          path: build/reports/tests/
```

### **Staging Deployment**
```yaml
  deploy-staging:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/staging'
    environment: staging
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: |
          # Deploy to staging environment
          echo "Deploying to staging..."
```

### **Production Deployment**
```yaml
  deploy-production:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    environment: production
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Deploy to production environment
          echo "Deploying to production..."
```

## 📊 **Success Criteria**
- [ ] All tests pass automatically on every commit
- [ ] Code quality gates are enforced
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities are detected early
- [ ] Staging environment is automatically updated
- [ ] Production deployments are automated and safe
- [ ] Deployment notifications are sent to team
- [ ] Rollback procedures are in place

## 🚀 **Benefits**
- **Faster Development**: Automated testing catches issues early
- **Quality Assurance**: Consistent code quality across team
- **Security**: Automated security scanning prevents vulnerabilities
- **Reliability**: Automated deployments reduce human error
- **Visibility**: Clear pipeline status and notifications

## 📝 **Notes**
- Consider using GitHub Environments for secrets management
- Implement proper branch protection rules
- Add performance testing with JMeter or similar
- Consider using Docker containers for consistency
