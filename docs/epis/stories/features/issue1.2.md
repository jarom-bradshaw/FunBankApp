# Issue 1.2: Profile Endpoint 400 Error After Login - RESOLVED ✅

## Resolution Summary
The profile endpoint issue was resolved by:
- Improving null checks and error handling in the profile endpoint
- Verifying session and authentication context with integration tests
- Ensuring CORS and cookie settings are correct
- Confirming the complete login → profile flow works in both tests and manual checks

All tasks and acceptance criteria are now complete. The authentication flow is fully functional.

## Problem
After successful login, the `/api/auth/profile` endpoint returns 400 Bad Request instead of user profile data. The login endpoint works perfectly, but the profile endpoint fails to retrieve the authenticated user's information.

## Error Details
- **Login Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/login` - ✅ WORKING (200 OK)
- **Profile Endpoint**: `GET /api/auth/profile` - ❌ FAILING (400 Bad Request)
- **Frontend Error**: "Request failed with status code 400"
- **Backend Log**: Profile endpoint returns 400 with error message

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be related to:
1. **Session/Authentication Context**: The authentication context may not be properly maintained between login and profile requests
2. **Cookie/Session Management**: The session cookie may not be properly set or sent with subsequent requests
3. **Security Context**: The SecurityContextHolder may not be properly populated after login
4. **CORS/Cookie Configuration**: Frontend may not be sending cookies with requests

## Tasks
- [x] Add debug logging to profile endpoint
- [x] Check if authentication context is properly maintained
- [x] Verify session cookie is being set and sent
- [x] Test profile endpoint directly with session cookie
- [x] Check CORS configuration for cookie handling
- [x] Verify SecurityContextHolder state in profile endpoint
- [x] Test with different authentication methods
- [x] Fix the identified root cause
- [x] Test complete authentication flow

## Debug Information Added
- Added comprehensive logging to profile endpoint to track:
  - Authentication object state
  - Principal information
  - User lookup process
  - Response generation

## Priority
**RESOLVED** - Login and profile retrieval now work end-to-end

## Dependencies
- Working login endpoint
- Session management
- Cookie configuration
- CORS settings

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Profile endpoint returns 200 OK with user data after login
- [x] Authentication context is properly maintained between requests
- [x] Session cookies are properly set and sent
- [x] Complete authentication flow works end-to-end
- [x] User can access protected resources after login
