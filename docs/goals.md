Minimum MVP Requirements (Pretty sure this is my final Requirements)
- Backend API to manage user authentication, accounts, chat, and data storage (Spring Boot, connects to SQL database) (Done and Tested)
- User registration and login (JWT authentication) (Done – with API)
- Secure password hashing (BCrypt) (Done)
- Chat interface for behavioral financial advice (CFP-style) (5% Done)
- Backend endpoint for chat/advice (integrated with LLM/AI, e.g., Ollama or OpenAI) (5% Done)
- Store and display chat history for each user (Not Started)
- Manual account entry and editing (balance, type, name) (Frontend that integrates with the API’s)
- Dashboard page to view accounts and net worth (Not Started)
- Project documentation (README, setup, requirements) (Continually Updated)
- 1-2 Stretch Ideas

## Stretch Ideas
- Account linking/aggregation (Plaid, Yodlee, etc.) (I would really like to do this, but I don’t know if there is anything I need to do to be careful)
- Monte Carlo simulations and financial projections (This would be so cool, but no clue how yet)
- Graphs/charts for net worth, spending, etc. (If I get far enough, I might include this in my minimum requirements)
- Personalized insights based on account data (This might be a prompt engineered response from Ollama that prints in a certain spot if I did this and it would appear under a networth))
- Transaction import/history (This would be cool, but I would need to see how most other FinApps do it)
- Goal tracking and planning (I would like this)
- Responsive, accessible UI with Material UI theming (Maybe)
- Dark/light mode toggle (I’ve done this before)
- User profile management (change password, email, etc.) (Should probably do this before other stuff)
- Email notifications for advice or reminders (ehhh, not as much about this one)
- Admin dashboard for user/account management (Maybe)
- Multi-language support (i18n) (Probably not)
- End-to-end tests with Cypress (Probably not)
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment (Likely)
- OAuth/social login (Google, GitHub, etc.) (Want to, but don’t know how this would affect my other API’s)
- Mobile app (React Native or similar) (Would be a future project)
