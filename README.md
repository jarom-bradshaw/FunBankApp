# Overview

I love finances and want to work in fintech someday. And the other day my brother told me he wanted to rent and build a 4-plex that he designed. He is a architect for the state of Nevada. I was curious about how much money he could make investing the down payment on the 4-plex, so I started analyzing the money on a spreadsheet.

Then I determined I would just build a documented mini hybrid bank app that aims to be connectible to real banks and a place that is safe and secure to put your data. I aim to implement API with Ollama to do some math on the balance available and provide a high level summary.

I also have hashed passwords and created Swagger documentation for the API's I have built out.

# Development Environment

Currently, I am hosting this on my SQL server. I am using JBDC for Database connectivity instead of JPA. That was a significant architecture decision, as I did not want to have more runtime by using JPA.

I am using Java Springboot framework. I am using JDK 21 Amazon Correto version. I am using Gradle, Bean, Lombok for clean code and a few other libraries, that I will document after being sure I am using them.

# Future Work

I have this listed out on a Trello Board as I am currently working on this alone and hope to work with other people. If you are good at frontend and graphic design, please reach out to me at jarombrads@gmail.com I'd love to work with you to publish this application.
