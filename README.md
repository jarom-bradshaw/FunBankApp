# Overview

I have a strong passion for finance and aspire to work in the fintech industry. Recently, my brother, an architect for the state of Nevada, expressed interest in renting and building a 4-plex he designed. This inspired me to analyze the financial aspects of such an investment using a spreadsheet.

To take this further, I decided to develop a mini hybrid banking application. This app is designed to connect with real banks and provide a secure environment for user data. It includes features such as balance calculations and high-level summaries using APIs integrated with Ollama.

I have implemented secure password hashing and created comprehensive Swagger documentation for the APIs I developed.

# Future Work

Note: This product is in the making. I am currently only locally hosting it and will later push it to the cloud.

I have outlined future enhancements on a Trello board. As I am currently working on this project alone, I am seeking collaborators, especially those skilled in frontend development and graphic design. If interested, please reach out to me at jarombrads@gmail.com. I would love to work with you to bring this application to fruition.
