# Issue 1.3: Migrate to HttpOnly Cookie Authentication

## Goal
Migrate from localStorage JWT tokens to HttpOnly cookies for stateless authentication, simplifying the frontend and improving security.

## Background
Currently using localStorage JWT tokens which:
- Require manual token management on frontend
- Are vulnerable to XSS attacks
- Create complexity with token refresh and validation
- Require Authorization headers on every request

## Proposed Solution
Implement HttpOnly cookie-based authentication:
- Backend sets HttpOnly cookies on login
- Frontend automatically sends cookies with requests
- No token management needed on frontend
- Better security against XSS attacks
- Industry standard approach

## Backend Changes Required

### 1. Update UserController.java
- [x] Modify login endpoint to set HttpOnly cookie instead of returning JWT in response body
- [x] Add logout endpoint that clears authentication cookie
- [x] Add CSRF token endpoint for frontend requests

### 2. Create CookieAuthFilter.java
- [x] Replace JwtAuthFilter with cookie-based authentication
- [x] Extract JWT from HttpOnly cookie instead of Authorization header
- [x] Validate JWT token from cookie
- [x] Handle missing or invalid cookies

### 3. Update SecurityConfig.java
- [x] Enable CSRF protection
- [x] Configure cookie-based authentication
- [x] Update CORS to allow credentials
- [x] Add CSRF token endpoint configuration

### 4. Update application.properties
- [x] Add cookie configuration (domain, secure, sameSite)
- [x] Configure session timeout
- [x] Set cookie attributes for security

## Frontend Changes Required

### 1. Simplify AuthContext.jsx
- [x] Remove token management logic
- [x] Keep only login state tracking
- [x] Remove localStorage operations

### 2. Update API Configuration
- [x] Remove Authorization header interceptors
- [x] Add `credentials: 'include'` to all requests
- [x] Add CSRF token handling for POST/PUT/DELETE

### 3. Update Components
- [x] Remove token validation from ProtectedRoute
- [x] Simplify Login component
- [x] Remove debug panels and token inspection
- [x] Update error handling

## Security Enhancements
- [x] HttpOnly cookie attributes
- [x] Secure flag for HTTPS
- [x] SameSite attribute configuration
- [x] CSRF protection
- [x] Proper CORS configuration

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Login flow works with cookies
- [ ] Protected endpoints accessible
- [ ] Logout clears cookies
- [ ] CSRF protection active
- [ ] Session expiration works
- [ ] Cross-origin requests work

## Implementation Order
1. âœ… Backend cookie authentication setup
2. âœ… Frontend authentication simplification
3. âœ… Security configuration
4. ðŸ”„ Testing and validation
5. ðŸ”„ Code cleanup

## Status
ðŸ”„ In Progress - Frontend implementation completed, ready for testing

## Problems Encountered

### 1. Test Failures
- **Issue**: Existing tests are failing because they expect JwtAuthFilter but we replaced it with CookieAuthFilter
- **Impact**: Build fails due to test failures
- **Solution**: Need to update test files to work with new cookie-based authentication
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ Pending - Tests need to be updated

### 2. Bean Definition Issues
- **Issue**: Tests show `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException` for JwtAuthFilter
- **Impact**: Test context cannot be loaded
- **Solution**: Update test configurations to use CookieAuthFilter instead
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ Pending - Test configurations need updating

## Frontend Changes Summary

### AuthContext.jsx
- âœ… Removed all token management and localStorage operations
- âœ… Simplified to only track login state
- âœ… Removed persistent logging and debug functions

### Login.jsx
- âœ… Updated to work with cookie-based authentication
- âœ… Added `credentials: 'include'` to fetch requests
- âœ… Removed token handling and storage
- âœ… Simplified login flow

### Dashboard.jsx
- âœ… Removed all token-related code and debug panels
- âœ… Updated logout to call backend logout endpoint
- âœ… Simplified authentication checks
- âœ… Removed token testing functionality

### axios.ts
- âœ… Added `withCredentials: true` for cookie transmission
- âœ… Removed Authorization header interceptors
- âœ… Simplified error handling for 401 responses
- âœ… Updated logging for cookie-based requests

### ProtectedRoute.jsx
- âœ… Simplified to only check login state
- âœ… Removed token validation and initialization checks

## Notes
- Keep JWT tokens inside cookies for stateless authentication
- Maintain same JWT validation logic, just change how tokens are transmitted
- Ensure backward compatibility during migration
- Backend changes are complete and ready for testing
- Frontend changes are complete and ready for testing
- Both backend and frontend now use HttpOnly cookie authentication
- No more localStorage token management needed
- Simplified authentication flow with better security
