# Issue 1.2: Fix CORS Issues and Implement Proper Authentication Flow

## Problem
- CORS errors when frontend tries to access backend API
- No authentication check on frontend routes
- Dashboard shows up without proper login validation
- Missing proper error handling for unauthorized requests

## Tasks
- [x] Fix backend CORS configuration in SecurityConfig
- [x] Add authentication check to frontend routes
- [x] Implement protected route wrapper
- [x] Add proper error handling for unauthorized requests
- [x] Test authentication flow end-to-end
- [x] Fix JWT token handling in API requests

## Status
Completed

## Completed
- Added CORS configuration to SecurityConfig with proper origin patterns
- Created ProtectedRoute component to check authentication
- Updated main.jsx to include AuthProvider and ProtectedRoute
- Updated Dashboard to use AuthContext and handle 401 errors
- Improved error handling to redirect to login on unauthorized requests
- Backend is now running successfully on port 8080
- Registration endpoint tested and working (testuser15 created successfully)
- Login endpoint processing requests correctly
- CORS issues resolved - no more connection refused errors
- **FIXED**: Added Axios interceptors to automatically include JWT token in all API requests
- **FIXED**: Removed manual Authorization headers from Dashboard component
- **FIXED**: Added proper 401 error handling in Axios response interceptor
- Authentication flow now works end-to-end: Login → Dashboard → API calls with JWT token
